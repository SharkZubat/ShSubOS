# ShSubOS
ShSubOS is the Python OS

**Note: This project is currently under development.**

## Systems
ShSubOS aims to support multiple operating systems. Currently, the primary focus is on developing a robust and efficient Python-based operating system.

## Kernels
The kernel is the core component of ShSubOS. It is responsible for managing system resources, providing low-level interfaces, and ensuring system stability. The ShSubOS kernel is being developed with a focus on modularity and performance.

## Shell
The ShSubOS shell provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It supports various commands and scripting capabilities, allowing users to automate tasks and manage the system efficiently.

### Commands
The shell supports a variety of commands for file management, process control, and system configuration. Some of the basic commands include:
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `cd`: Change the current directory
- `cp`: Copy files and directories
- `mv`: Move or rename files and directories
- `rm`: Remove files or directories

## Emulation
ShSubOS includes emulation capabilities to run software designed for different hardware architectures. This feature is crucial for testing and compatibility purposes, allowing developers to ensure their applications work across various environments.
